# RoboNavigator
# Robot Simulator

A simple React application that simulates controlling a robot on a 5x5 grid. The robot can be rotated to face any cardinal direction and moved forward or backward within the grid.

## Features

- **5x5 Grid:** Visual representation of a grid where the robot can move.
- **Movement Controls:** Move the robot forward and backward.
- **Rotation Controls:** Rotate the robot left or right.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to fit modern web browsers.
